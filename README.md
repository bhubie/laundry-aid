# laundry-time

### Problem
- Laundry at the new house we are renting is located in a shed and does not have a timer on the machine

### Solution
- Create a system that will notify you when the washer or dryer is finished

### Why not just set a timer?
- because there is no fun in that :)

### Built Using:
- Node
- React
- Express
- Socket.io

### TODO:
- Alexa skill integration to start timer via spoken commands
- CSS styling for web page
